# Capstone 2024 
This my capstone proejct for the Spring 2024 semester at Vanderbilt University. 

## Modernization of Accounting Processes
This repository contains the code and resources for a project aimed at modernizing and streamlining the accounting processes of a small accounting firm in Monaco. The project focuses on automating several key aspects of the business operations, including transaction analysis for AML compliance, client onboarding, paystub generation, and client billing through SEPA payments.

### Project Components
* Client Onboarding and Transaction Analysis: Automates the processing of monthly transaction data using Python and pandas, reducing manual effort and enhancing accuracy.
* PowerPoint Automation: Uses Python and the python-pptx library to generate dynamic PowerPoint presentations for client and internal use.
* SEPA Payments Automation: Implements a system to automate the generation of SEPA files for client billing, streamlining transactions with minimal client involvement.
* Paystub Automation: Enhances the payroll process with an automated system to calculate and generate paystubs, tailored to the specific tax regulations of France, Italy, and Monaco, using Python, Flask, and PDFKit.

### Technologies Used
Python, pandas, python-pptx, Flask, PDFKit

#### Note to user: 
For obvious privacy and professional reasons I cannot put out the full code and most importantly the data here for some aspects of this project, however the code in this repo should be enough to get you 80% of the way.
